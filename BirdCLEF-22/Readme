# BirdCLEF-2022: Bird Call Classification

This project focuses on classifying bird calls using a fine-tuned ResNet-50 machine learning model. By converting audio files into **Mel-spectrograms**, we transform the bird call data into a visual format suitable for training a convolutional neural network.

### Challenge Overview

The **BirdCLEF-2022** competition is a part of the larger LifeCLEF challenge, which encourages innovative approaches to species classification based on audio data. In this project, we use the challenge dataset to create a bird call classifier.

### Approach

- **Model**: The ResNet-50 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, is fine-tuned to work with bird call data.
- **Data Processing**: Audio files are transformed into **Mel-spectrograms**, a type of visual representation of sound, which is then used to train the model.
- **Training**: After converting the audio to Mel-spectrograms, we use supervised learning to fine-tune the ResNet-50 model on this dataset.

### Dataset

### Results

The model was fine-tuned over 50 epochs, and we achieved promising results in classifying the bird calls. The performance can be further improved with additional fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques.
